# Hackathon_Hore

A 1-Day Hackathon Project : "Berangan"
--
An app that we (HoreHoreTeam) made on Hackathon 2022 Competition held by Cybertech from PNP (Politeknik Negeri Padang). Briefly, In that competition, we created an app that will show the user, the latest info about commodity's price in each market near current user location. For example, the user can see each of carrot price per kg in every market near her current location, so she will buy it at the market that has the cheapest carrot's price and the shortest distance from her house. So the user can go buy commodities efficiently.

Also, In this app, we used an public REST API to get the data, so we can integrate it into our application.
